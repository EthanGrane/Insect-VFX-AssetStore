## About
### Description:
Insect VFX [HDRP, URP, Built-In] brings your scenes to life with swarms of cockroaches, spiders, or rats, perfect for realistic horror scenes or sci-fi urban ambients! This package uses C# to perform particle simulations on the CPU.

Features:

Insect Effects: Includes a cockroach model with animations (with and without lifetime limits), a spider model with animations, and a scene with all package content. Each effect is scalable and customizable, allowing easy adjustments of particle size, swarm size, particle count, and more.
Optimized and Scalable Pathfinding System: Designed to handle multiple swarms, this system enables insects to navigate complex environments without compromising performance.

### Render pipeline compatibility:
The Built-in Render Pipeline is Unityâ€™s default render pipeline. It is a general-purpose render pipeline that has limited options for customization. The Universal Render Pipeline (URP) is a Scriptable Render Pipeline that is quick and easy to customize, and lets you create optimized graphics across a wide range of platforms. The High Definition Render Pipeline (HDRP) is a Scriptable Render Pipeline that lets you create cutting-edge, high-fidelity graphics on high-end platforms.
